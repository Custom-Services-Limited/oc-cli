## Extending OC-CLI

You can create custom commands by extending the base Command class:

```php
<?php

namespace OpenCart\CLI\Commands\Custom;

use OpenCart\CLI\Command;

class MyCustomCommand extends Command
{
    protected function configure()
    {
        $this
            ->setName('custom:my-command')
            ->setDescription('My custom command description');
    }

    protected function handle()
    {
        $this->io->success('Hello from my custom command!');
        return 0;
    }
}
```
